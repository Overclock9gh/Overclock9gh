I'm finishing my last semester at Montmorency College where I'm studying in computer science. I'm good and like every aspect in the domain but I prefer specifically security and network management. When I was younger, I often received computer parts from my uncle who was a programmer and he took the time to explain their operation, which greatly influenced my choice of a career. I often spend my free time to play chess because I think that strategic games are the best things to improve our logic and programming needs a lot of that. My academic goal is to do a Bachelor of Information Technology Engineering. I worked as a computer technician at school and now Iâ€™m a tutor for the students at the  second and fourth semester in Network and Security technical program. My work experiences have allowed me to adapt easily with various technologies and multiple technical problems or customer misunderstanding.
